\section{Partial Derivative of a Tensor}\label{sec:6.1}
In the last chapter, we met algebraic operations which are tensorial, that is, which convert tensors into tensors. The operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and contraction. The next question which arises is, What differential operations are there that are tensorial? The answer to this turns out to be very much more envolced. The first thing we shall see is the partial differentations of tensors is \textbf{not} tensorial. Different authors denote the partial derivative of a contravariant vector $X^{a}$ by $$\partial_bX^{a}\quad \mbox{or} \quad \pdv{X^{a}}{x^b}\quad\mbox{or}\quad \tensor{X}{^{a}_{,b}} \quad \mbox{or}\quad \tensor{X}{^{a}_{|b}}$$
